	<br><br>I'm <b><a href="index.html">Aliza</a></b>, a 23-year-old Pakistani <b>Multidisciplinary Designer</b>, who loves <b>collaboration</b>, <b>curiosity</b>, and <b>complexity</b>. I have an <b>MFA in Design and Technology</b> from Parsons School of Design and a <b>Bachelor of Industrial Design</b> from NUST, Pakistan.

	<br><br>I care about the relationships and politics of <b>spaces</b>, <b>human senses</b>, <b>technologies</b>, and <b>scale</b>, and I want to be creating the kind of design work being done at HUSH. I'm interested in <b>tactile technology</b> and <b>experiential design</b> that <b>evokes</b> something – a memory, a sense of place, an emotion, a transcendence, a texture, a thought, etc.

	<br><br>You can view my skills and experience on my <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HIKrm4yLKD5G0ZLmhnH0NJJb8AE0pKW/view?usp=sharing">resume</a></b>, but what I really care about is working on <b>meaningful concepts</b> through making, experimentation, collaboration and drinking tea. Then, using whatever skills, tools, materials, or mediums necessary to <b>beautifully craft a concept into existance</b>.

	<br><br>I’d love to contribute my skills, ideas, and perspectives at HUSH while learning and growing as a designer. What I bring with me is a <b>perpetual curiosity</b>, an unconventional <b>multi-cultural</b> educational background, my unique <b>perspective</b>, a love for work driven by <b>strong concepts</b>, hands that love to tinker and <b><a href="https://www.alizam.design/prototype">make</a></b>, and a <b>resilient</b> spirit.
